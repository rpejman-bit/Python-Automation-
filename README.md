Goal: Learn the basics of Python. Gain an introductory understanding of common Python objects and basic operators and structures. 


Part I:
1. Create a list of hypothetical file names using a for loop:
1. a) Create a list with the following strings as elements: 'roads', 'cities', 'counties', 'states'
2. b) Create an empty list and then populate it by concatenating each of the strings above
with ‘.txt’. This should result in a list of strings ending in .txt (e.g. ‘roads.txt’, ‘cities.txt’, etc.).


2. Write a while loop that raises the mathematical constant pi (3.14159...) to its powers until the
result is greater than 10,000 (i.e. pi 0 , pi1 , pi2 ,...).
